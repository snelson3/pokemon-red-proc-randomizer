mapObjects

warp db
1st arg is y coordinate of warp
2nd arg is x coordinate of warp
3rd arg is ?
4th arg is the warp pointer I think
  -1 seems to say go to the overworld,
      crashes when in overworld

warp-to is related to coming back

Can use mapheaders to see if it's an overworld map
    Changing the tileset used will break things

utils class
    would be nice to have add/replace LineOfFunc method

you can make oaks speech even shorter (not show nidorino/etc)
  editing OakSpeech in oak_speech.asm

level scaling will be an eventual option for map randomness

warps randomizer should be a little better
overworld randomizer

Need to experiment with different maps, see if the -1 crashes/etc




It would be a good idea to make sure a spoiler log is actually being generated (option to have it be it's own seed)
  This way if there's ever a bug with something crashing because the wrong data is in the wrong place
   you will be able to see exactly what the data is, which should make it easier to reproduce

Want to get the warps where it doesn't break often
Then randomize connections, which I imagine will cause a lot of broken seeds
Then get basic BLK reading working, so that I can add some logic to check that maps aren't shoved together in
 a way that blocks things off
then that can slowly get more advanced and be more logical

eventual goal is to create a whole new map from scratch, that uses like a genetic algorithm to procedurally make the map
