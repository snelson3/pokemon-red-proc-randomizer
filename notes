mapObjects

warp db
1st arg is y coordinate of warp
2nd arg is x coordinate of warp
3rd arg is ?
4th arg is the warp pointer I think
  -1 seems to say go to the overworld,
      crashes when in overworld

warp-to is related to coming back

Can use mapheaders to see if it's an overworld map
    Changing the tileset used will break things


Setting the special warp like this puts you in oaks lab
;Format:
;	db Map_id
;	FLYWARP_DATA [Map Width][Y-pos][X-pos]
;	db Tileset_id
FirstMapSpec:
	db OAKS_LAB
	FLYWARP_DATA OAKS_LAB_WIDTH,5,5
	db OAKS_LAB

PalletTownScript0 is what triggers oak finding you

OaksLabScript16 might be the conversation you have at the start of oaks lab
OaksLabScript5

OaksLabScript11 is possibly the script that makes you fight your rival in oaks lab
    no its the script that starts the battle but retting it makes a softlock happen

SetEvent EVENT_OAK_ASKED_TO_CHOOSE_MON

EVENT_PALLET_AFTER_GETTING_POKEBALLS

Finish start of game hack and code that
method to randomize starting pokemon
method to randomize wild pokemon placements
warps randomizer should be a little better
overworld randomizer

default options should be better, or text speed instan hack

utils class
    add line/replace line methods
    would be nice to have add/replace LineOfFunc method

you can make oaks speech even shorter (not show nidorino/etc)
  editing OakSpeech in oak_speech.asm


level scaling will be an eventual option for map randomness
