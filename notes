mapObjects

warp db
1st arg is y coordinate of warp
2nd arg is x coordinate of warp
3rd arg is what doorway of the destination map are we going to
4th arg destination map
  -1 seems to say go to the overworld (back where came from),
      crashes when in overworld

warp-to is related to coming back

Can use mapheaders to see if it's an overworld map
    Changing the tileset used will break things

utils class
    would be nice to have add/replace LineOfFunc method

you can make oaks speech even shorter (not show nidorino/etc)
  editing OakSpeech in oak_speech.asm

level scaling will be an eventual option for map randomness

warps randomizer should be a little better
overworld randomizer

Need to experiment with different map objects, see if the -1 crashes/etc
Also need to figure out warp-to better


so the -1 obviously crashes the game when you go there from the overworld,
but if I make it so going to oaks lab goes to pewter poke center, then leaving center has a broken tileset
    This is occuring because the wrong tileset is getting loaded
        If I hardcode leaving pewter pokemon center to be pallet town, it breaks
           If I hardcode it to the correct spot it works

Note going somewhere from the overworld doesn't seem to have the tileset loading problem

I think I just had a breakthrough
the 3rd argument of the warp line specifies which warp_to to use, so if it specifies a warp_to that doesn't exist, things break


There are constants for the overworld, so you can use those instead of the -1's.

So somethings up

It would be a good idea to make sure a spoiler log is actually being generated (option to have it be it's own seed)
  This way if there's ever a bug with something crashing because the wrong data is in the wrong place
   you will be able to see exactly what the data is, which should make it easier to reproduce

Want to get the warps where it doesn't break often
Then randomize connections, which I imagine will cause a lot of broken seeds
also would be fun to have a sprite randomizer that randomized all the sprites
   could limit it to just trainers, or just pokeballs, or do everything
Then get basic BLK reading working, so that I can add some logic to check that maps aren't shoved together in
 a way that blocks things off
then that can slowly get more advanced and be more logical

eventual goal is to create a whole new map from scratch, that uses like a genetic algorithm to procedurally make the map
   The starting point would be to just take each map, and create a new layout for it that still connects/works

I should probably rearchitect this to have a better high level/low level separation (high level logic for the randomization doesn't know anything about the files)
  will let me extend to other pokemon games a bit better
  however This is fine for now, as I'm mostly exploring and seeing what I can do.
  Just something for when it gets more mature/when I think about making it actually ready for the public


Silph Co Elevator has a "237" destination pointer, which is a little weird
  I think for now I can just have that be ignored in the randomization

I need to figure out where the constant title is kept for each map

As I try to generate a map data structure that links all the maps together

Warps seed 1531980321 can mess things up

My electron based selector should have an option to create a random seed with each option randomly turned on/off

Need to figure out why warping from one overworld map to another overworld map doesn't load things properly  (it's kind of random)
My guess would be it tries to load as an inside map

Looks like BLK files correspond to blocks, it's a 2D map with the block pointers laid out.
https://github.com/pret/pokered/tree/master/gfx/blocksets
  that's in hex too, gotta figure out how that corresponds
    Think that probably corresponds to the tiles, each block is 4x4 so I imagine that's how it works
red stands on a 2x2 set of tiles
each byte in the .blk's corresponding .bst file corresponds to a tile in the corresponding tilemap (0 is the top left)


overworld tileset .png is 16 x 6 tiles (96)
.tilecoll might be bit's corresponding to tiles?
   More complicated, 0ing or Fing out the file made me unable to walk really in the overworld
       maybe it's 2 bits long or something, since water is something, also wild pokemon maybe

overworld.tilecoll is 40 bytes long
so

BUGS
loading 0, ROUTE_11 breaks, might be because it looks like digletts cave has a special load function (ctrl F stuff)
